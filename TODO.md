# To - Do

## ESP32 SonicLib BSP + echo-mode hardware test

`src/apps/echo_mode_hardware_test/` (renamed from `hardware_bringup`) - POST + free-running
single-sensor rangefinding loop (`main/rangefinder_loop.c`). **Verified running successfully on
real hardware (2026-09-10).**

### Next - tune, then move on to pitch-catch
- [ ] Tune the `RF_*` `#define`s at the top of `rangefinder_loop.c` against real targets:
      thresholds (false targets vs missed targets), `RF_TX_PULSE_US` (far-target echo strength),
      `RF_RX_GAIN_REDUCE` / `RF_RINGDOWN_CANCEL_SAMPLES` (near-field / ringdown false targets).
- [ ] Optional, improves close-range accuracy: `ch_set_init_firmware(&dev, icu_init_init)` before
      `ch_group_start()` + `ch_meas_optimize()` after building the queue (auto-dampens ringdown;
      ~250 ms, run once). `icu_init` is already compiled in.
- [ ] SPI clock is a conservative 1 MHz (`BSP_SPI_CLOCK_HZ` in `esp32_bsp_internal.h`); raise it
      now that framing is confirmed working (datasheet max 13 MHz).
- [ ] Longer-term / only if needed: non-blocking I/Q readout (`chbsp_spi_mem_read_nb`) is
      unimplemented (falls back to the `chbsp_dummy.c` error stub) - add it if higher-throughput
      non-blocking reads become necessary.

## Pitch-catch mode hardware test

`src/apps/pitch_catch_mode_hardware_test/{sender,receiver}` - scaffolded (empty), not yet
implemented. Two sensors: one `CH_MODE_TRIGGERED_TX_RX` (sender), one
`CH_MODE_TRIGGERED_RX_ONLY` (receiver), synchronized via the shared INT1 trigger wire between
boards (see PCB v3 note below). Free-running mode cannot be used for multi-sensor sync - see
AN-000175 §2.4/§2.7.
- [ ] Build out `sender`/`receiver` apps, reusing `src/components/{invn-soniclib,
      soniclib_esp32_bsp,icu_post}` the same way `echo_mode_hardware_test` does.
- [ ] Consider whether `icu_post`'s `post_run()` still applies as-is for a receive-only sensor
      (stage 3 identity checks should be fine; no measurement config assumptions to revisit).


## PCB Design
- [ ] Change the terminology used on the solder bridges
- [ ] Add red/green LEDs for indicating operational status (power-on self-test result, runtime errors, etc)
